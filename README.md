## Why
At XeTute Technologies, we understand the challenges of serving high-quality, fast LLM-powered applications with limited resources. When we were a smaller company, this was especially difficult.

To address this, we are introducing this endpoint, available at **http://ai.xetute.com/v1**, to support startups, small companies, and private individualsâ€”particularly in the Islamic Federal Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of China. Our goal is to provide access to a high-quality LLM model free of charge, enabling you to build and serve applications with ease.

## Privacy
Your inputs, and those of your users, are never logged, saved, or monitored by us. This ensures that no one, including ourselves, can access your prompts or the model's generations.
If you wish to save inputs and outputs, you must implement that functionality yourself in your application.

## License
The model being served is often changes, but you can retrieve it throught the API: "https://ai.xetute.com/api/v1/model".  
The used model is **always** licensed under either **Apache 2.0** or **MIT**. The Quantization level can also be red from the name responded by the API.  

All generations from the model belong to you. If you are serving the model through your application, the ownership of generations can be decided by you or your users.

## Capabilities
Mostly, a minimum of context length 8192  / 8k tokens is used, but this can be higher too. The minimum TPS(tokens per second) while generation recorded was 8TPS.

## Endpoints
The model is hosted using **KoboldCPP**, which also offers a WebUI for interactive usage. You can use the following endpoints:
